This is a crude addon that will display a tooltip on item to explain the Mutiny guild's (Nightslayer-US) loot priority.
I found it cumbersome to look at a speadsheet on another monitor when voting on Loot Council loot. This addon brings the relevant priority information from that spreadsheet in-game.
